01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,566
[audience welcoming applause]

2
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,766
>> SVEN GRUNDBERG: Thank you Junghun.
And, hello everybody.

3
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:11,766
So today,

4
01:00:12,816 --> 01:00:18,483
I first want to go quickly through some of the reasons
we at Embark wanted to make this game.

5
01:00:18,483 --> 01:00:24,949
And, go into a bit more detail about the underlying
trend that we are tapping into with ARC Raiders.

6
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:29,916
I will also share an overview of the game, the premise,
and the world, and the universe we have built.

7
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:35,116
And, the role you take in this universe,
your objectives and motivations as a Raider

8
01:00:35,116 --> 01:00:39,150
fighting for your own survival and that of
your home and colony.

9
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:45,266
And lastly, I will give you a brief update on where we are,
and some news and our steps a head.

10
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:58,433
>> SVEN: ARC Raiders is a game that taps deep into
something we at Embark like to call:

11
01:00:58,433 --> 01:01:00,816
"consequential play".

12
01:01:00,816 --> 01:01:05,366
This is one of the clearest and most profound trends
in the games industry over the past decade.

13
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:10,316
It is a trend that we think has spurred the creation of
some of the last decades most popular games

14
01:01:10,316 --> 01:01:11,466
and game modes.

15
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:16,816
It is a trend that has been with us for some time,
but that continues to accelerate and grow.

16
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:23,183
"Consequential play" is seen in games where choices matter,
and where failure has consquences.

17
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:27,666
It is best defined by a few important game mechanics,
and philosophies,

18
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:31,683
that lead to more impactful and persistent
consequences for players.

19
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:36,116
These are mechanics that give players a sense
of impact and control over gameplay.

20
01:01:36,116 --> 01:01:40,133
Mechanics that: reward risk according to the challenge.

21
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:44,933
And, mechanics that: lets players be in control
of their stakes.

22
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,650
>> SVEN: "Consequential play" is not limited to any single
genre.

23
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:57,349
In fact, you see it across a number of different
game genres, like Battle Royales,

24
01:01:57,349 --> 01:02:02,666
Extraction games, Survival games,
Rougelikes, and Soulsbornes.

25
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:07,983
As I said, many of the most popular and acclaimed new
game releases over the past 10 years.

26
01:02:07,983 --> 01:02:14,000
And what these contain are things like
single-life sessions, which means you cannot respawn.

27
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,949
Or permadeath, which means that you only have
one try, or where failure means

28
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:21,666
the potential loss of progression.

29
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:25,349
All of this ensures high-stakes,
consequential play.

30
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,366
And that takes us to ARC Raiders.

31
01:02:28,366 --> 01:02:32,683
We have been quiet about ARC Raiders for
a little while here, as we develop the game.

32
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:38,233
But, it is finally time for us to start showing you,
and the world, this game of ours.

33
01:02:38,233 --> 01:02:39,449
So, lets take it away.

34
01:02:39,666 --> 01:02:45,533
>> SVEN: ARC Raiders is a third-person PvPvE
action survival shooter, emphasizing immersion,

35
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:50,500
tense action, consequential play, deep progression,
and high usability.

36
01:02:51,516 --> 01:02:56,583
It is set on Earth several hundred years into
the future, following a mass exodus of

37
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:59,500
humans into space due to an ecological collapse.

38
01:03:00,066 --> 01:03:04,683
And, this is a large and expansive universe...
and we are inviting all of you to explore

39
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:06,883
this vast and beautiful world.

40
01:03:08,133 --> 01:03:14,483
It is a high-stakes game, with high tension.
Where you play in various hostile and dangerous locations.

41
01:03:14,483 --> 01:03:18,866
Out there, as a Raider, you need to savenge
and hunt for resources for your colony.

42
01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:25,783
But in your way, stands ARC machines.
This is a musterious deadly foe with a hidden agenda.

43
01:03:25,783 --> 01:03:31,133
Ranging from small drones, to lethal mechanical giants.

44
01:03:33,266 --> 01:03:38,650
And of course, other players - Raiders - who are also
in the world competing with you for loot.

45
01:03:39,766 --> 01:03:43,949
This means that the gameplay and the mechanics
are centered around human vs human,

46
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:50,050
human vs machine, and having to grapple with
a conflicting nature of your own humanity.

47
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:53,316
It is a game that lives on tension from the
combination of these mechanics.

48
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:58,916
You have to be on your toes, you have to carefully
consider your way to your goal.

49
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:03,250
And, prepare for the unknown,
and be ready for any danger on your way.

50
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:10,116
>> SVEN: And, when the action does happen,
it is a peak

51
01:04:10,116 --> 01:04:16,449
that contrasts the moment that came before it.
The action is visceral, tactile, and grounded.

52
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:21,583
And, it will invite you to a rich sandbox of
gadgets and tools, some of it more familiar

53
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:26,016
and some of it more exotic, utilitatian Raider tech.

54
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:32,166
And besides just scavenging, and looting, and
the visceral combat, the traders

55
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:36,833
in your colony, Speranza, will send you out on quests.
Such as discovering probes

56
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:45,900
deployed by ARC from orbit, or uncovering mysteries,
or challenges, to bring back special ARC materials,

57
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,833
and sometimes having to fight the machines for it.

58
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:54,750
But to reap the rewards and to grow as a Raider,
you will have to make it out alive,

59
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,933
and return back to the colony. Return home.

60
01:04:58,933 --> 01:05:03,416
This is where you trade your loot, and your valuables.
To build, and upgrade, and improve,

61
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:05,750
and expand your chambers. Your home.

62
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:11,566
And ultimately grow your own character, your Raider,
and your loadout, to suit your playstyle.

63
01:05:11,566 --> 01:05:13,966
To become the Raider that you want to be.

64
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:20,949
ARC Raiders presents itself as an immersive adventure.
And, our ambition has been here to create a vibrant,

65
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:27,000
and inviting world that we want you to love to explore.

66
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,966
Even though the world as we know it is gone,
and the premise is dark, the presentation of

67
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:36,316
this game is deliberately colorful, charming,
and grounded.

68
01:05:36,316 --> 01:05:39,416
We want this world to feel real, and alive.

69
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:44,166
The massive colony we live in is fractured.
But the neighborhood of Speranza,

70
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:49,000
that we call home, is cozy, it is immersive,
and it feels like a real place.

71
01:05:49,683 --> 01:05:53,483
The traders, and the quest givers that you
interact with are real people.

72
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:58,833
And, as you start playing this game, your journey
has just begun, and the stories in our universe will

73
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:02,883
take you into new adventures across the world.

74
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:09,699
Our world will always grow bigger, and take players
futher away beyond the first valley,

75
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:14,416
evolving the game world, the gameplay,
and the player experience itself.

76
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:18,766
>> SVEN: So, we recently made a few annoucements
around the development, and where are are.

77
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,966
So, let's not beat around the bush,
and let you in on what is next for the game.

78
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:29,616
Firstly, the public playtesting of ARC Raiders
is starting already this fall. Next month.

79
01:06:29,616 --> 01:06:34,633
We are starting with the first playtest on Steam,
between October 24th and 27th.

80
01:06:34,633 --> 01:06:40,916
And players will have to sign-up for playtesting
on our Steam app, to get an opportunity to play.

81
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:42,750
And, console testing will follow later.

82
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:47,300
And secondly, we have an update on the
release of the game.

83
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,333
ARC Raiders will be released in 2025 on PC,
that is Steam and Epic Games Store.

84
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:56,300
Consoles, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S,
and cloud streaming through Nvidia GeForce Now.

85
01:06:58,116 --> 01:07:01,933
With that I want to leave you a trailer,
and thank you so much.

01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:05,133

>> CELESTE: Where do we go from here?

88
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:18,566
You've told us nothing of this place.

89
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:30,483
Look at us now,

90
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,766
Raiders,

91
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:39,250
playing with fire.

92
01:07:43,033 --> 01:07:44,883
Everything to lose,

93
01:07:47,516 --> 01:07:49,500
but even more to gain.

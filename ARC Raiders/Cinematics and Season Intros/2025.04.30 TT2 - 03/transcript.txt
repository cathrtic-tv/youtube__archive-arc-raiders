["Embark Studios presents"] 
["ARC Raiders"] 

>> CITIZEN #1: A bed down here in Speranza sure beats sleeping outside. 
But it's getting pretty crowded. 

[background colony chatter] 
[cooking noises] 

>> CITIZEN #2: Up Topside, clean hands don't get the work done. 
That's why I stay down here. 
Everything has a price, and it's always higher than you think. 
>> LANCE: —1,358 days to make a beautiful— 
[radio static: off] 
>> CELESTE: Raiders may not follow orders, but they'll follow a bounty, if it's high enough. 

>> SHANI: I wouldn't worry about other Raiders that much, I would worry about ARC. 
[ARC sounds] 
Something's going on. 

>> APOLLO: A lot of people down here in Speranza reply on Raiders. 
I don't like it, but if you wanna go back up, you catch a ride with the Tubes on level four. 
They'll take you all the way to Buried City. 

>> SHANI: Okay, here we are. This room is the best I can do for you now. 
It's a dump, I know, but you'll learn to love it, I'm sure. 
Come see me when you've settled in.

01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,500
["Embark Studios presents"]

2
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:10,199
["ARC Raiders"]

3
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,766
>> CITIZEN #1: A bed down here in Speranza
sure beats sleeping outside.

4
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:18,599
But it's getting pretty crowded.

5
01:00:20,633 --> 01:00:24,133
[background colony chatter]

6
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:28,566
[cooking noises]

7
01:00:29,566 --> 01:00:32,800
>> CITIZEN #2: Up Topside,
clean hands don't get the work done.

8
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,400
That's why I stay down here.

9
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,599
Everything has a price,
and it's always higher than you think.

10
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:41,233
>> LANCE: —1,358 days to make a beautiful—
[radio static: off]

11
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:46,166
>> CELESTE: Raiders may not follow orders,
but they'll follow a bounty, if it's high enough.

12
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:50,866
>> SHANI: I wouldn't worry about other Raiders
that much, I would worry about ARC.

13
01:00:50,866 --> 01:00:54,400
[ARC sounds]
Something's going on.

14
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:58,833
>> APOLLO: A lot of people down here in
Speranza reply on Raiders.

15
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:03,266
I don't like it, but if you wanna go back up,
you catch a ride with the Tubes on level four.

16
01:01:03,266 --> 01:01:05,266
They'll take you all the way to Buried City.

17
01:01:05,566 --> 01:01:09,800
>> SHANI: Okay, here we are.
This room is the best I can do for you now.

18
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,533
It's a dump, I know, but
you'll learn to love it, I'm sure.

19
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,566
Come see me when you've settled in.

It was silent for years.
Just whispers.
Distant cracks of thunder.
No one paid attention.
I wish we did.

ARC threatens any possible settlement on the surface.
When one machine falls, another takes its place.
In the hidden city of Toledo, thousands seek shelter.
Many of them rely on vital supplies from the surface.
Among the fierce competition for these resources â€” only a few dare to go topside.
They are known as Raiders.

01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,300
["2180"]

2
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,400
["Rust Belt | South Calabretta"]

3
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,133
>> RAIDER: It was silent for years.

4
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:19,300
Just whispers.

5
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:25,666
Distant cracks of thunder.

6
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:29,466
[thunder rumbles]

7
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:33,066
No one paid attention.

8
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:35,699
[distant ARC laser]

9
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,533
I wish we did.

10
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,099
["ARC threatens any possible settlement on the surface.
When one machine falls, another takes its place."]

11
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
["In the hidden city of Toledo, thousands seek shelter.
Many of them rely on vital supplies from the surface."]

12
01:00:57,966 --> 01:01:04,133
["Among the fierce competition for these resources â€”
only a few dare to go topside."]

13
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:11,066
["They are known as Raiders."]

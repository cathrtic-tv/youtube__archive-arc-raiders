01:00:05,866 --> 01:00:08,400
>> RAIDER: The camps...

2
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,466
Feels like forever we could spend
our nights on the surface;

3
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:21,133
when we still thought we had a chance
against the machines.

4
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:27,800
Precious few still believe, these days.

5
01:00:29,966 --> 01:00:34,166
Now we cower underground; scramble over scraps.

6
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:38,366
Feels like a different world,


7
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,133
yet the camps still stand...
